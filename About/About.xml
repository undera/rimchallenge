Mod adds challenge concept to the RimWorld game.

Challenge is a condition in game that you have to complete. Like "Kill 100 animals" or "Create a masterpiece sculpture". Challenges are meant to be not easy, and you are rewarded for completing them.

Completed challenges are remembered by game and not available for choice in any storyline. You can reset completed challenges back via mod settings menu.
